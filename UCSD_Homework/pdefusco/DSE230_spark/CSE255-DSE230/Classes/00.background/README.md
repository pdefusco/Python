# Review notebooks

This directory contains a collection of ipython notebooks for learning
how to perform standard IO in python. Comparing performance of 
python, numpy and Cython, and a whole directory of notebooks about
doing data science with Pandas.

Pandas is not strictly needed for the course, but pandas DataFrames
provide excellent background to learning Spark DataFrames.
